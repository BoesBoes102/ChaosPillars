# Chaos Pillars

Chaos Pillars is a Minecraft minigame plugin for Paper servers, written in Java.
Players are teleported onto bedrock pillars in a circle and compete to be the last one standing. The game features random item drops, a timer with a boss bar, a scoreboard, and automatic player elimination.
